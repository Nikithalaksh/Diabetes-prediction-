# Introduction

This project is aimed at predicting whether an individual is diabetic or not based on various medical attributes. 
The model is built using machine learning algorithms and can be used as a tool to know a person is diabetic or not before hand.

## Requirements

Python, 
Pandas,
Numpy and 
sklearn for metrics and accuracy.


## The model Design

This is being modelled by different factors,they are: 
Separating the model through the Outcome. 
Finding their mean values.
Standardizing the values for the prediction.
Then the model is being pushed inside the train test split.
Here, the model is evaluated by train and test, to make sure the predictions are accurate.
Finally, we can predict by giving our input values to check whether the outcome(diabetes or not diabetes) is correct according to the data.   

The model is trained on a diabetes dataset and can accurately predict whether a patient is diabetic or not with an accuracy of around 77%.
